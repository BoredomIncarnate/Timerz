# Timerz App iOS & Mac

APPLE YOU ARE BEING CALLED OUT! I HAVE A SERIOUS COMPLAINT! 

WHY?!


WHY DON'T YOU HAVE MUTLIPLE TIMERS?!?!

WHY CAN'T SIRI ADD TIME TO A TIMER?!?!

...

TIMERZ, my great app! DOES (_**Will**_) just that! It makes timers, but with the extra zang of a 'z'.

You're gonna be able to add time and REMOVE time for those timers.

You're gonna be able to rename those timers!

### TODO

- [x] Add Time To Timer
- [x] Remove Time From Timer
- [ ] Rename Timer

### THE FUTURE!

I'm really interested in getting Siri integration into my app so I can actually use it while cooking. There is nothing more frustrating than not being able to time two different things cooking at the same time!

#### TODO
- [ ] Siri `create` Timer
- [ ] Siri `stop` Timer
- [ ] Siri `resume` Timer
- [ ] Siri `rename` Timer
